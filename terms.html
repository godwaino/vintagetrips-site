  <p>Welcome to VintageTrips. By using our website and services, you agree to these Terms & Conditions. Please read them carefully.</p>

  <h2>1. About VintageTrips</h2>
  <p><strong>Company Name:</strong> VintageTrips<br>
  <strong>Website:</strong> vintagetrips.com<br>
  <strong>Contact:</strong> godwin@sabsdomains.com</p>
  <p>VintageTrips is a travel concierge service specializing in curated vintage and heritage travel experiences. We act as an intermediary between travelers and travel service providers (hotels, train operators, tour companies, etc.).</p>

  <h2>2. Services We Provide</h2>
  <p>VintageTrips offers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Itinerary planning:</strong> Custom travel itineraries based on your preferences</li>
    <li><strong>Booking assistance:</strong> Help securing reservations with partner providers</li>
    <li><strong>Travel guidance:</strong> Destination advice, timing recommendations, packing tips</li>
    <li><strong>Content & inspiration:</strong> Guides, articles, and travel ideas</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> operate hotels, trains, tours, or other travel services directly. We connect you with trusted third-party providers.</p>

  <h2>3. How Our Service Works</h2>
  
  <h3>3.1 Itinerary Request Process</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>You submit a custom itinerary request via our website form</li>
    <li>Our team reviews your preferences and budget</li>
    <li>We send you a personalized itinerary proposal within 48 hours</li>
    <li>You review, request changes, and approve the itinerary</li>
    <li>We assist with bookings and confirmations (subject to availability)</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>3.2 No Guaranteed Availability</h3>
  <p>All itineraries are <strong>subject to availability</strong> at the time of booking. Heritage trains, boutique hotels, and popular experiences often sell out months in advance. We cannot guarantee availability until bookings are confirmed and paid.</p>

  <h2>4. Pricing and Payments</h2>
  
  <h3>4.1 Indicative Pricing</h3>
  <p>All prices quoted in itineraries are <strong>indicative estimates</strong> based on current rates. Final pricing depends on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Availability at time of booking</li>
    <li>Seasonal rates and demand</li>
    <li>Exchange rate fluctuations (for international bookings)</li>
    <li>Partner provider terms and conditions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We will always confirm final pricing before you commit to any booking.</p>

  <h3>4.2 Service Fees</h3>
  <p>VintageTrips may charge a planning/concierge fee for complex itineraries. This fee covers research, booking coordination, and ongoing support. Fees will be disclosed upfront before you proceed.</p>

  <h3>4.3 Payment Terms</h3>
  <p>Payments are made directly to travel service providers or through VintageTrips (acting as agent). Payment schedules vary by provider:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Deposits typically required at booking (25-50% of total cost)</li>
    <li>Full payment usually due 60-180 days before travel</li>
    <li>Last-minute bookings may require immediate full payment</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Cancellations and Refunds</h2>
  
  <h3>5.1 Provider Cancellation Policies</h3>
  <p>Each travel provider (hotel, train, tour operator) has its own cancellation policy. VintageTrips does not set these policies. Common terms include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Heritage trains:</strong> Non-refundable or 25-50% cancellation fee if canceled 90-180 days before departure</li>
    <li><strong>Hotels:</strong> Typically refundable up to 7-30 days before check-in (varies by property)</li>
    <li><strong>Tours:</strong> Often require 60-90 days notice for refunds</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We will clearly communicate all cancellation terms before you book.</p>

  <h3>5.2 VintageTrips Cancellations</h3>
  <p>If you cancel an itinerary request <strong>before any bookings are made</strong>, there is no charge. Once bookings are confirmed, provider cancellation policies apply.</p>

  <h3>5.3 Force Majeure</h3>
  <p>In cases of force majeure (natural disasters, pandemics, war, government restrictions), refunds depend on provider policies and travel insurance coverage. VintageTrips will assist with rebooking or claims but cannot guarantee refunds beyond what providers offer.</p>

  <h2>6. Travel Insurance</h2>
  <div class="highlight-box">
    <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Important:</strong> We <strong>strongly recommend</strong> purchasing comprehensive travel insurance covering cancellations, medical emergencies, trip interruptions, and lost luggage. VintageTrips is not responsible for costs incurred due to unforeseen circumstances.</p>

    <li><strong>Vaccinations:</strong> Meeting health requirements (consult your doctor and official government sources)</li>

  </ul>
